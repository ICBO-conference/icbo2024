<h1> ICBO 2024 <small>conference</small></h1>

## General Information 

The International Conference on Biological and Biomedical Ontology
(ICBO) is a premier annual conference series that brings together
researchers, students and professionals involved in the development
and application of ontologies in all areas of biology, medicine,
diseases, human health, genome biology, environment, biomes,
nutrition, food, plants, agriculture and others. Together, they
address issues pertaining to coordinated development of ontological
resources, data standards, as well as the optimal use of ontologies in
applications.

The focus of the ICBO 2024 conference is <b> Unifying Biological
Knowledge: From Molecules to Ecosystems</b>.

ICBO 2024 will be colocated with the <a
href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/fois2024/">14th International
Conference on Formal Ontology in Information Systems (FOIS)</a>.
