# Traveling to Enschede

## Arriving By Air

We recommend to fly to Schiphol Airport that has direct flights from most of the cities with <a href="https://www.klm.nl/en">KLM</a> or <a href="https://www.transavia.com/">Transavia</a>. From Schiphol airport there are trains towards Enschede Central Station every 30 min, they alternate between direct and semi-direct (you need to change in the same platform in Amersfoort Central). It takes around 2 hours to reach Enschede.

You can also fly to Eindhoven airport but the connection to Enschede takes longer. You would need to pick the bus to reach Eindhoven Central Station and from there pick the train to Utrecht Central and change trains to Enschede Central or Utrecht- Amersfoort-Enschede: they alternate every half an hour. This trip takes around 3h.

## Train Tickets 

To buy the train ticket, you can do it at the train station from the airport or by the <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/ns-app">NS app</a>. The ticket will be valid during the day of the travel. In case you buy the physical ticket on the machine you would need to check in with the yellow sticks (see picture), this will validate your ticket.

There is also the possibility to pay directly with your debit/credit card. You check in at the station of origin and check out at Enschede Station (using the yellow barriers). 

In the Netherlands the trains have 2nd class and 1st class, the normal ticket covers 2nd class, take a look at the number on the wall of the carriage to see which class you are travelling.

We recommend you check on the day of travel if the trip is possible (sometimes there are disruptions), for that the best is to use the <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/ns-app">NS app</a> or the <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en">NS webpage</a>.

## Bus Tickets

On the bus you can pay with your credit/debit card and check out when you leave the bus. The travel will be charged depending on the distance.
