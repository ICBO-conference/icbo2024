# ICBO Conference Proceeding Publication Requirements

**ICBO conference proceedings are often published in CEUR. Below, we have included language for the requirements to do this. Edit the content indicated by '-> <-' to suite your specific conference.**   

**An example from a past conference can be seen [here](https://icbo-conference.github.io/icbo2022/workshop-publication-requirements/)**  


Conference submissions will be published in the [CEUR Workshop Proceedings](http://ceur-ws.org/). In order for this to happen, the following requirements must be satisfied.  

1. Ensure that the conference name, date, and place, and email addresses and ORCIDs of all authors are added to the footnote on the lower left of the first page.  An example of how this should look can be found [here](images/ICBO_Author_Footnote.jpg). The copyright should read **-> INSERT YEAR <-** as well.  



2. All papers for ICBO need an accompanying signed **Author Agreement to Publish a Contribution as Open-Access on CEUR-WS.org** prepared by the corresponding author. Please download the ICBO customized form [here](ceur-author-agreement-ccby-ntp-for-ICBO.pdf) **-> CHANGE FORM FOR SPECIFIC CONFERENCE <-**.
Fill in the fields on the form, print it out, sign it in ink, then scan or photograph the form and send it to **-> INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS <-** with a subject heading that reads "Author Agreement for submission [*PAPER-ID*]". Do NOT digitally sign the pdf, as CEUR-WS.org will not accept it. CEUR-WS.org allows an alternative method to provide a signature if you are unable to print the form, as shown here: [http://ceur-ws.org/agreement-paper1.jpg](http://ceur-ws.org/agreement-paper1.jpg)
