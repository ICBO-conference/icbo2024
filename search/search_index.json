It's built on the Bootstrap 3 framework and includes pre-packaged: highlight.js v9.18.0 syntax highlighting with support for 185 languages (over 30 by default) and over 90 styles FontAwesome v5.12.0 icon support smashingly legible type scheme to get your message out to your users You are viewing the theme in action and can see a selection of the theme elements on the Specimen page . Install \u00b6 Required : Python 3.4+ Install MkDocs & Create a New Project \u00b6 If you haven't installed MkDocs yet, use the following command to install it: $ pip install mkdocs Next, navigate to a clean directory and create a new MkDocs project with the following command: $ mkdocs new [projectname] Replace [projectname] with the name of your project (without the brackets). Then navigate to the root of your project directory: $ cd [projectname] Install the Cinder Theme \u00b6 Download the Cinder theme archive by clicking the button below. Download Cinder Unpack the contents of the archive into a directory named cinder at the top level of your MkDocs project directory. Your project directory should now look like this: . \u251c\u2500\u2500 mkdocs.yml \u251c\u2500\u2500 cinder \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 css \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 img \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 js \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 base.html \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 content.html \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 404.html \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 nav-sub.html \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 nav.html \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 toc.html \u2514\u2500\u2500 docs \u2514\u2500\u2500 index.md MkDocs projects use a YAML settings file called mkdocs.yml . This is located in the root of your project directory after you use the mkdocs new command. Open the file in a text editor and modify it to include the theme settings as follows: site_name: [YOURPROJECT] theme: name: null custom_dir: 'cinder' nav: - Home: index.md See the MkDocs documentation for additional details. Updates, the Manual Approach If you choose the manual install approach, you can update your Cinder theme by downloading the new cinder.zip release archive and including it in your project. Then re-build your static site files (see instructions below). Test with a Local Site Server \u00b6 Use the following command to establish a local server for your site: $ mkdocs serve Then open your site in any browser at the URL http://localhost:8000 . Create Your Site \u00b6 Add Content with Markdown Syntax \u00b6 Get to work on your site home page by opening the docs/index.md file and editing it in Markdown syntax. The HTML automatically updates in the browser when you save the Markdown file if you use the MkDocs server (see command above). Add New Pages \u00b6 Add new pages to your site by creating a new Markdown file in your docs directory, then linking to the new page in the mkdocs.yml file. This uses a Page Name : Markdown file syntax. For example, to add an About page using a Markdown file that is located on the path docs/about.md , you would format the mkdocs.yml file as follows: site_name: [YOURPROJECT] theme: name: null custom_dir: 'cinder' nav: - Home: index.md - About: about.md Add additional pages to your site by repeating the above series of steps. Build Your Site \u00b6 Build your site files with the command: $ mkdocs build Your site files are built in the site directory and are ready to use. Deploy the contents of the site directory to your web server. Important Configuration Issues \u00b6 Please review these issues before you push your site into a production setting! 1. Set the site_url configuration field \u00b6 You must set the site_url field in your mkdocs.yml file to the appropriate production URL in order to generate a valid sitemap.xml file ( issue #80 ). Here is an example from the Cinder project mkdocs.yml file : site_name: Cinder site_url: https://sourcefoundry.org/cinder/ site_author: Christopher Simpkins site_description: \"A clean, responsive theme for static documentation websites that are generated with MkDocs\" repo_url: \"https://github.com/chrissimpkins/cinder\" copyright: \"Cinder is licensed under the <a href='https://github.com/chrissimpkins/cinder/blob/master/LICENSE.md'>MIT license</a>\" theme: name: null custom_dir: cinder colorscheme: github highlightjs: true hljs_languages: - yaml nav: - Home: index.md - Specimen: specimen.md markdown_extensions: - admonition The sitemap.xml file will be located at [SITE_URL]/sitemap.xml when you push your site into the production environment. During development the sitemap.xml file can be found at http://127.0.0.1:8000/sitemap.xml . Site Customization \u00b6 The following are a few common customizations that you might be interested in. For much more detail about the configuration of your site, check out the MkDocs Configuration documentation . Syntax Highlighting Color Scheme \u00b6 Cinder supports the 90+ highlightjs color schemes . The github color scheme that you see on this page is the default and will be used if you do not specify otherwise. To change to a different scheme, include the colorscheme field under the theme field in your mkdocs.yml file and enter the color scheme name. For example, to switch to the Dracula theme , enter the following: theme: name: null custom_dir: cinder colorscheme: dracula and then rebuild your site. The color scheme name should match the base name of the highlightjs CSS file. See the src/styles directory of the highlightjs repository for a complete list of these CSS paths. Syntax Highlighting Language Support \u00b6 By default, Cinder supports the ~30 syntaxes listed under common in the documentation . You can broaden support to any of the over 130 highlightjs languages using definitions in your mkdocs.yml file. To add a new language, create a list of additional languages as a hljs_languages sub-field under the theme field in the mkdocs.yml file. The definitions are formatted as a newline-delimited list with - characters. For example, to add support for the Julia and Perl languages, format your configuration file like this: theme: name: null custom_dir: cinder hljs_languages: - julia - perl Use the base file name of the JavaScript files located in the CDN for your syntax definitions. Site Favicon \u00b6 Create an img subdirectory in your docs directory and add a custom favicon.ico file. See the MkDocs documentation for additional details. Add Your Own CSS Stylesheets \u00b6 Create a css directory inside your docs directory and add your CSS files. You can overwrite any of the Cinder styles in your CSS files. Then include your CSS files in the mkdocs.yml file with the extra_css field: site_name: [YOURPROJECT] theme: cinder extra_css: - \"css/mystyle.css\" - \"css/myotherstyle.css\" nav: - Home: index.md - About: about.md Your CSS styles fall at the end of the cascade and will override all styles included in the theme (including Bootstrap and default Cinder styles). You can find the Cinder and Bootstrap CSS files on the paths cinder/css/cinder.css and cinder/css/bootstrap.min.css , respectively. Add Your Own JavaScript \u00b6 Create a js directory inside your docs directory and add your JS files. Then include your JS files in the mkdocs.yml file with the extra_js field: site_name: [YOURPROJECT] theme: cinder extra_js: - \"js/myscript.js\" - \"js/myotherscript.js\" nav: - Home: index.md - About: about.md Keyboard shortcuts \u00b6 Place the following in your mkdocs.yml file to enable keyboard shortcuts: shortcuts: help: 191 # ? next: 39 # right arrow previous: 37 # left arrow search: 83 # s The numbers correspond to the key that you would like to use for that shortcut. You can use https://keycode.info/ to find the keycode you want. Extending Cinder \u00b6 Create a new directory within your project (e.g., cinder-theme-ext/ ) and create main.html . Add the following line at the top of the HTML file. {% extends \"base.html\" %} Instead of using theme_dir: cinder in mkdocs.yml , use: theme: name: cinder custom_dir: [custom dir] Refer to MkDocs Documentation - Using the theme custom_dir for more information. Use the following examples as reference. You can put your own Jinja2 within the blocks. More information can be found in MkDocs Documentation - Overriding Template Blocks . Adding extra HTML to the head tag \u00b6 Append to main.html : {% block extrahead %} <meta name=\"author\" content=\"{{ page.meta.author }}\"> {% endblock %} Replacing footer \u00b6 Append to main.html : {% block footer %} <hr> <p>{% if config.copyright %} <small>{{ config.copyright }}<br></small> {% endif %} <small>Documentation built with <a href=\"http://www.mkdocs.org/\">MkDocs</a>.</small> {% if page.meta.revision_date %} <small><br><i>Updated {{ page.meta.revision_date }}</i></small> {% endif %} </p> {% endblock %} page.meta.revision_date can be set by using meta-data (front-matter) at the beginning of your Markdown document or using mkdocs-git-revision-date-plugin . Github or Bitbucket Repository Link \u00b6 Include the repo_url field and define it with your repository URL: site_name: [YOURPROJECT] theme: cinder repo_url: \"https://github.com/chrissimpkins/cinder\" nav: - Home: index.md - About: about.md The link appears at the upper right hand corner of your site. License Declaration and Link \u00b6 The Cinder theme displays your license declaration in the footer if you include a copyright field and define it with the text (and optionally the HTML link) that you would like to display: site_name: [YOURPROJECT] theme: cinder copyright: \"Cinder is licensed under the <a href='https://github.com/chrissimpkins/cinder/blob/master/LICENSE.md'>MIT license \" nav: - Home: index.md - About: about.md Disabling Theme Features \u00b6 The Cinder theme can turn off some theme features entirely in mkdocs.yml , for situations where you don't need these features. If this is all the customization required, it saves overriding theme files. For example: theme: name: cinder # Turn off Previous/Next navigation links in the navbar disable_nav_previous_next: true # Turn off Search in the navbar disable_nav_search: true # Turn off the site_name link in the navbar disable_nav_site_name: true # Turn off the footer entirely disable_footer: true # Turn off the default footer message, but display the page revision date if it's available disable_footer_except_revision: true Issues \u00b6 If you have any issues with the theme, please report them on the Cinder repository: Report Issue Active Issues License \u00b6 Cinder is licensed under the MIT license .","title":"Example1"},{"location":"example1/#about","text":"Cinder is a clean, responsive theme for static documentation sites that are generated with MkDocs .

Aspects of this broad concept include trust in the output of any ML proces (and the prevention of black boxes, hallucinations and so forth). The very trust in science is at stake, especially now that paper mills come up that also aggravate the perverse reward systems in current research environments, which are stuck in 20th (in fact 17th) century scholarly communication. The other side of the same coin is that ML, if nor properly controlled will also break through security and privacy barriers and violate GDPR and other Ethical, Legal and Societal barriers, including equitability. In addition, the \u2018existence\u2019 of data somewhere by no means implies its actual Reusability. This includes the by now well established four elements of the FAIR principles: Much data is not even Findable, if found, not Accessible under well defined conditions, and if accessed not Interoperable (understandable by third parties and machines) and this results in the vast majority of data and information not being Reusable without violation of copyrights, privacy regulations or the basic conceptual models that implicitly or explicitly underpin the query or the deep learning algorithm. This keynote will address how \u2018data visiting\u2019 as opposed to classical \u2018data sharing\u2019, which carries the connotation of data downloads, transport and loosing control, mitigates most, if not all, the unwanted side effects of classical \u2018data sharing\u2019. For federated data visiting, the data should be FAIR in an additional sense or perspective, they should be \u2018Federated, AI-Ready\u2019, so that visiting algorithms can answer questions related to Access Control, Consent, Format, and can read rich (FAIR) metadata about the data itself to determine whether they are \u2018fit for purpose\u2019 and machine actionable (i.e. FAIR digital Objects, or Machine Actionable Units). The \u2018fitness for purpose\u2019 concept goes way beyond (but includes) information about methods, quality, error bars etc. The \u2018immutable logging\u2019 of all operation of visiting algorithms is crucial, especially when self learning algorithms in \u2018swarm learning\u2019 are being used. Enough to keep us busy for a while. Prof Michel Dumontier \u00b6 Recent advances in artificial intelligence offer tantalising possibilities to propel translational research and improve patient outcomes. Central to this transformation is the question of whether our knowledge infrastructure, namely the quality of our health data, the adequacy of health data standards, and the extensibility of our biomedical ontologies, is both necessary and sufficient to deliver anticipated benefits. This keynote presentation will address the critical role of biomedical ontologies in health AI, assessing their readiness in this rapidly evolving field, and exploring novel developments afield, namely neurosymbolic reasoning systems. I will delve into the specific requirements that biomedical ontologies must meet to be considered AI-ready, including the quality of conceptual detail, the breadth of (bio)medical scope, and their adaptability to new and emerging knowledge. I will also explore the potential consequences of deploying AI without the foundational support of ontology-backed knowledge graphs, such as risks of misinterpretation of medical data and challenges in achieving interoperable health systems. Viewed through the lens of US and European initiatives that our research group is spearheading, I will discuss collaborative efforts between clinical experts, data scientists, and AI developers to refine and expand knowledge frameworks, ensuring they are not just ready but also central to the future of healthcare. Keynotes FOIS (Share with ICBO) \u00b6 Prof Mieke Boon \u00b6 This keynote address at FOIS 2024 delves into the epistemological aspects of AI explainability. Drawing on the perspective of Logical Empiricism, the talk examines Carl Hempel's covering law theory of scientific explanation, which posits that laws derived from inductive reasoning explain specific events. However, this account faces challenges, such as distinguishing between accidental regularities and genuine laws, leading to the exploration of explainability in machine learning (ML). While ML models provide accurate predictions, their opacity prompts the need for explanations behind these predictions. Explainable ML (XML) aims to extract reasons for predictions but may struggle to provide genuine explanations akin to shortcomings in Hempel's theory. Instead, the talk advocates for a mechanistic view of explanation, suggesting that ML explainability should be sought outside the ML models, within a conceptual model (CM) of the real-world phenomenon. The CM guides the construction of ML models, ensuring relevance of variables and facilitating explanations of outcomes. Consequently, ML models serve as instruments for quantitative analysis, while the CM serves as the explanatory framework, grounding explanations in the understanding of the target phenomenon. This approach shifts the focus from the inner workings of ML models to the broader conceptual understanding of the phenomena they seek to explain, providing a more robust foundation for AI explainability. Prof Frank van Harmelen \u00b6 After the breakthroughs of machine learning (deep learning or otherwise) in the past decade, the shortcomings of machine learning are also becoming increasingly clear: unexplainable results, data hunger and limited generalisability are all becoming bottle necks. As a result, the combination of data-driven techniques from machine learning with symbolic techniques from knowledge representation is now recognised as one of the grand challenges of modern AI. Surprisingly, the role of ontologies has been largely neglected in many of the neuro-symbolic systems that have been published. Fortunately, this is has been changing recently, and I will give an overview of a number of proposals from the literature for neuro-symbolic systems where ontologies play a key role. Prof \u00d8ystein Linnebo \u00b6 G\u00f6del and others have suggested that a set can be regarded as constructed from its elements. Given any objects, we can apply the \u201cset of\u201d operation to construct the set of these objects. Inspired by G\u00f6del\u2019s suggestion, this talk presents a far more general constructional approach to ontology. First, I clarify what it is for some objects to be \u201cconstructed\u201d from others. The key is that all truths about the \u201cnew\u201d objects that are constructed must reduce to truths about the \u201cold\u201d objects on which the construction is based. Then, I explain the central role of criteria of identity in the constructional approach. When constructing \u201cnew\u201d objects, it is particularly important to stipulate what it takes for them to be identical or distinct. A variety of examples are provided, including mereological sums, ordered pairs, as well as cardinal and ordinal numbers. Finally, I present a logical framework in which this constructional approach can be developed. In this framework, a large and natural family of forms of construction can be proved to be consistent.

Aspects of this broad concept include trust in the output of any ML proces (and the prevention of black boxes, hallucinations and so forth). The very trust in science is at stake, especially now that paper mills come up that also aggravate the perverse reward systems in current research environments, which are stuck in 20th (in fact 17th) century scholarly communication. The other side of the same coin is that ML, if nor properly controlled will also break through security and privacy barriers and violate GDPR and other Ethical, Legal and Societal barriers, including equitability. In addition, the \u2018existence\u2019 of data somewhere by no means implies its actual Reusability. This includes the by now well established four elements of the FAIR principles: Much data is not even Findable, if found, not Accessible under well defined conditions, and if accessed not Interoperable (understandable by third parties and machines) and this results in the vast majority of data and information not being Reusable without violation of copyrights, privacy regulations or the basic conceptual models that implicitly or explicitly underpin the query or the deep learning algorithm.
